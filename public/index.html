    <title>UNSHELTERED - Inspiring stories challenging misconceptions about disabilities</title>
    <meta name="description" content="UN-SHELTERED explores deeply a cross-section of lives touched by disabilities, revealing a sense of similarity as opposed to difference in the human experience. Unscripted, and with the sole purpose to change the way the wider world views people living with disabilities, UN-SHELTERED challenges the viewer to look closely at their own lives and preconceived opinions of equality and social change.">
