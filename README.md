To serve the files for local development, first make sure you have yarn installed and have run `yarn install` to pull
the dependencies. From there, you can run 

`yarn serve`

to start up a development server and have Webpack automatically watch and compile files.

Run `yarn build` to build a production build. It will be put in the `dist` folder.
